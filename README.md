## Local Setup Instructions 💻

### Follow these steps to setup project locally:
```
Step 1: Fork the project.

Step 2: Clone it to your local system.

Step 3: Check if Node is installed in your Operating system.

a) To check if Node is installed, open the command prompt or similar command line tool and type 'node -v'. This should print a version number which means Node is successfully installed.

b) If you see an error, it means that Node is not installed in your OS. You can download Node.js from 'https://nodejs.org/en/download/'. After completing the installation repeat the part (a) of step 3.

Step 4: On command prompt under your cloned folder directory path, run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies.

Step 5: Finally run 'npm start' to start the application.

Step 6: Visit localhost:3000 in your browser.

## General Guidelines for Contributors 🚧
### Some Guidelines need to be followed to maintain the decorum in the community.
### Keep these points in mind while contributing the resources 👇🏻

1. Add topics in the same format as they are added in the above files i.e as Javascript objects.
2. Maximum 6 links can be added under each category.
3. Quantity of resources doesn't matter but quality does so even if 3-4 good resources of each are available, put them under each category. 
4. If any topic doesn't fall under given tags, you can create a new tag and start entering the data in it.
5. The new tag should be put in the Data folder and Readme.md should be updated for the same.
6. Kindly add the topic and tags (if you are creating a new one) in alphabetical order. 

(Separate issues can be created to integrate a new topic from the Data folder into the app)
